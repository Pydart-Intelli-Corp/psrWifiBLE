30.0,3.8,7.9,42.00
```

### Binary Data
BLE communication supports binary data transfer for sensor readings and control commands.

## Use Cases

### Agricultural Applications
- **Milk Quality Testing**: Store and retrieve milk fat, SNF, and CLR data
- **Price Calculation**: Automatic pricing based on quality parameters
- **Data Logging**: Record test results with timestamps
- **Remote Monitoring**: BLE connectivity for mobile apps

### IoT Data Logger
- **Sensor Data Storage**: Log data from multiple sensors
- **Remote Configuration**: Update settings via WiFi
- **Data Synchronization**: Transfer data between local and cloud storage
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live data streaming via BLE

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **SD Card Not Detected**
   - Check physical connections
   - Ensure card is properly formatted (FAT32)
   - Verify SD card detect pin wiring

2. **WiFi Connection Failed**
   - Check SSID and password
   - Verify signal strength with `RSSI` command
   - Restart device with `RST` command

3. **BLE Not Working**
   - Ensure BLE is started with `Start_ble`
   - Check device compatibility (BLE 4.0+ required)
   - Verify no interference from other 2.4GHz devices

4. **File Operation Errors**
   - Check available space with `Size` commands
   - Ensure files are properly closed after operations
   - Verify file permissions and naming conventions

### Memory Considerations
- SD card files can be large (limited by card capacity)
- LittleFS is limited by ESP32-S3 flash size
- Keep file operations chunked for large files (512-byte buffer used)

## Development Notes

### Code Structure
- **Modular Design**: Separate functions for each feature
- **State Management**: Uses global variables for connection states
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and reporting
- **Memory Management**: Efficient buffer usage for file operations

### Performance Optimization
- **Chunked File Reading**: 512-byte buffers prevent memory overflow
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking WiFi and BLE operations
- **Smart Reconnection**: Automatic retry mechanisms with timeouts
